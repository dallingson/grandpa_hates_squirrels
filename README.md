## 🎮 Overview
**Grandpa Hates Squirrels** is a chaotic side-scrolling platformer where you play as an old man defending his yard from hordes of mischievous squirrels.  
Armed with only a cane (and a bad temper), Grandpa must jump, swing, and survive as long as he can while the squirrels get faster and meaner.
